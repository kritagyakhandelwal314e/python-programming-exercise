# Python Programming Exercises
## Following are few programming exercises:
1. ### Implement Queue using python List
2. ### write following additional methods for Queue: method to reverse a Queue using recursion, method which returns minimum(smallest) element in the queue(considering all elements in the queue are of same datatype)
3. ### Given a list of N positive integers and a number S, find out and return a continuous sub-list sum of whose elements is S, return empty list if no such sub array exists
4. ### Given a matrix (list of lists) of size N*M and a number X, find if X is present in matrix
5. ### Given a positive integer N, print pretty square of N.
    - Pretty square of 1 is : <br>
    
      > 1<br>
    - pretty square of 2 is: <br>
    
      > 2 2 2<br>
      2 1 2<br>
      2 2 2<br>
    - pretty square of 3 is: <br>
    
      > 3 3 3 3 3<br>
      3 2 2 2 3<br>
      3 2 1 2 3<br>
      3 2 2 2 3<br>
      3 3 3 3 3<br>
